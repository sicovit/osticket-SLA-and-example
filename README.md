<p>
To configure SLAs (Service Level Agreements), go to Admin Panel > Manage > SLA Plans, where you can create time-based rules such as how long a ticket should be responded to or resolved. You can assign these SLA plans to specific help topics or departments, so different types of tickets follow different timelines.

 After SLAs are set, staff can view and manage tickets under the Tickets tab, where they can assign, respond, and change ticket status. You can also use filters and queues to help route tickets automatically based on priority or department.

Group policies related to the help topics in osTicket control who can see and act on certain tickets. This setup helps ensure all support requests are handled within the expected time frame, keeping things organized and accountable.
